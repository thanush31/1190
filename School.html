	<h3><u>Overview</u></h3>
	<p><i>THE world today poses multiple challenges when it comes to the growth trajectory of our career development. With the rapid growth in telecommunication systems, consumer electronics, and computer-based designs, REVA University keeps electronic and microelectronic embedded systems at the core of these technological developments.

	REVA’s B.Tech. in Electronics and Computer Engineering B.Tech. (ECM) programme is designed to provide quality education imparting skills in both electronics hardware, software, and IT development. Electronics and Computer Engineering is a branch of electronics engineering that deals with the effects of electrons to build components, devices, systems, or equipment.

	Not only do the students of computer engineering deal with the design of computers and computer systems along with fundamental aspects of electronics hardware concepts, but they also learn to design new hardware and software. REVA’s computer engineers work on a system's software as well. This provides the perfect balance of the best of both worlds – software driven by hardware which makes the transition to the world of job opportunities feel seamless.

	Developed in response to the needs of industries, this programme will render advanced level knowledge and skills in the design of complex software-enabled electronic and microelectronic hardware systems. To meet this demand, the curriculum has been specifically designed in consultation with technocrats from various industries.

	Apart from Electronics fundamentals, B.Tech. ECM graduate gets exposure to building smart systems that involve sensors, processors, actuators, communication networks, IOT, Data Science, and Data Analytics. The present world sees rapid growth in telecommunication systems, consumer electronics, and computer-based designs keeping electronics, microelectronics, and embedded industries. This programme will render advanced level knowledge in the design of complex software-enabled electronic and microelectronic hardware systems. Data inference, algorithm development, and technology in order to solve analytically complex problems. This curriculum has been designed in consultation with technocrats from relevant industries and academicians.

	The difference between B.Tech. Computer Science and Engineering graduate and B.Tech. Electronics and Computer Engineering graduate is that B.Tech. ECM graduate will study the fundamentals of electronics hardware design rather than only focusing on programming and IT aspects. In the future, graduates having this type of co-design skill set are required in a huge number of industries ranging from defense applications, aeronautical, automobile, healthcare, agriculture applications, and the scientific community.
	Research and Innovations in REVA University is regarded as one of the most important activities besides teaching and learning. The university with dedicated & qualified faculty, dynamic research scholars, moderate research facilities, well drafted research quality assurance guidelines, and supportive management provides an excellent ambience to pursue research in various disciplines. Research circles, mentored by senior faculty members are active in all the schools and are primarily responsible for cultivating interdisciplinary research cultures in students and faculty. Faculty members are successful in procuring grants from various government and industrial organizations with the matching grants from the university.

	Societal issues are the primary focus for students and faculty members to carry out explorative research. The well-structured regulations in line with UGC regulations and experts in relevant disciplines provide an enriching experience for research scholars. The rigorous course work followed by comprehensive progress review meetings make the research programme at REVA truly competitive. The university with its modest beginning has a grand vision to be recognized as a university committed for applied research towards societal issues. We invite dedicated, passionate and enthusiastic researchers to be a part of this grand vision.
